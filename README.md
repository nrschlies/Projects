# Projects

A collection of projects I've worked on:

- **Encryption Algorithms**:
    - **Description**: An ambitious endeavor into  cryptography, developing the following algorithms using built-in C methods.
        - Files:
            - 3des.c
            - CaesarCipher.c
            - RSA.c
            - algotest.c
            - caesar_cipher.c
            - enigma_machine.c
            - playfair_cipher.c
            - rc4.c
            - substitution_cipher.c
            - transposition_cipher.c
            - vigenere_cipher.c
  
- **ENGR-102-Final**: 
    - **Description**: A culmination of ENGR102: Electromechanical System Design. Showcased a robot car demonstrating line tracking and obstacle detection capabilities.
  
- **ENGR-103**: 
    - **Description**: Over the duration of this semester-long course, ideated and prototyped an obstacle detection system catered for the Braille Institute for the Blind.
  
- **pi_approx.py**:
    - **Description**: Implemented Monte Carlo approximation alongside a circle representation to analytically deduce the value of pi.

- **led-cam.py**: 
    - **Description**: Utilizes face_recognition library for RasPi cam and checks if that face recognition is in the list of blacklisted users. If the raspberry pi camera detects a blacklisted face, a series of Neopixel lights alternate in a blue-red pattern.
    - **Author**: Noah Schliesman
  
- **spotify-analytics.py**: 
    - **Description**: Utilizes Spotify API to calculate and present average analytics of a playlist in a tkinter GUI window. Metrics include average danceability, energy, key (WIP), loudness, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, and duration.
    - **Note**: To experiment, input your Spotify Developer Client ID and Client Secret.

- **LED-Paintings**: 
    - **Description**: Developed Arduino code using a joystick to transition between various programs designed for an LED strip.
  
- **wiki-find.py**: 
    - **Description**: Generates a random Wikipedia article displayed in a tkinter window using the Wikipedia library. 
  
- **test_with_openai.py**: 
    - **Description**: Interface blending OpenAI's cutting-edge capabilities with Text-to-Speech technology. Still under development.
 
- **8qnsv2.py**:
    - **Description**: N-Queens puzzle utilizing three strategies: Simulated Annealing, Hill Climbing with Sidestep, and Depth First Search, this project exhibits depth in understanding AI search algorithms. With `tkinter` at its core, the GUI presents an aesthetic visualization of real-time puzzle-solving, making it a compelling tool for both educational demonstrations and AI enthusiasts.
