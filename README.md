# Projects
Some of the projects I've worked on:

* **wiki-find.py:** Uses Wikipedia library to generate random article in a tkinter window.  
* **led-cam.py:** Uses Raspberry Pi camera to recognize faces and shine red and blue lights if the face is a match to a predetermined list.  
* **ENGR-102-Final:** Final project of ENGR102: Electromechanical System Design, built a robot car to showcase line tracking and obstacle detection.  
* **spotify-analytics.py:** Uses Spotify API to take the average analytics of a playlist and place them into a tkinter GUI window to present the average danceability, energy, key (WIP), loudness, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, and duration of a playlist. To test it out, enter your own Spotify Developer Client ID and Client Secret.
* **ENGR-103:** Throughout the semester long course, contains the Ideation and prototyping of an obstacle detection system for the braille institute.
* **LED-Paintings:**
