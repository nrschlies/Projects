# Projects
Some of the projects I've worked on:

* **wiki-find.py:** Uses Wikipedia library to generate random article in a tkinter window.  
* **led-cam.py:** Uses Raspberry Pi camera to recognize faces and shine red and blue lights if the face is a match to a predetermined list.  
* **ENGR-102-Final:** Final project of ENGR102: Electromechanical System Design, built a robot car to showcase line tracking and obstacle detection.
