/*
 * Code written by Noah Schliesman for Arduino
 * Uses an arduino and a joystick to rotate through different LED programs.
 * 
 * Mode 1: Paintings (Art from Sasha Bukh):
 * Uses a 100x3 matrix to store rgb values and randomly picks a pixel to put into a neopixel.
 * Rotate through paintings with joystick movement.
 * Rotate to mode 2 by pushing the joystick.
 * 
 * Mode 2: Special Functions (Some code repurposed from Adafruit):
 * Specific functions written for led strip.
 * Rotate through functions with joystick movement.
 * Rotate back to mode 1 by pushing the joystick.
 * 
 * All code has been written for noncommercial purposes.
